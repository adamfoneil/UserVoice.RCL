This is to act as a user-facing dashboard for collecting feedback, UAT sign-off, and feature voting as a Razor Class Library so that it can be added via NuGet package to any Blazor app.

My thinking here is that if all your work is in a private repo, your end users can't see or submit Issues. You can of course use the GitHub API for surfacing Issues in a unique way, and I've tried this. It's doable, but a bit complicated in the end -- espcially when you consider all the interactions and unique data I want to pack into this, such as [Voting](https://github.com/adamfoneil/UserVoice.RCL/blob/master/UserVoice.Database/Vote.cs) and [AcceptanceRequests](https://github.com/adamfoneil/UserVoice.RCL/blob/master/UserVoice.Database/AcceptanceRequest.cs). Or you can make a public repo specifically for Issue collection. I've done that before too. The downside of this is that end users need a GitHub account. For my situation, this is not a good solution. I wanted a user engagement portal that integrates seamlessly into my application. That way there's no additional login, and I can implement custom functionality specific for this use case.
